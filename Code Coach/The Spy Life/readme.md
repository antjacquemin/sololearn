# The Spy Life
You are a secret agent, and you receive an encrypted message that needs to be decoded. The code that is being used flips the message backwards and inserts non-alphabetic characters in the message to make it hard to decipher.
## Task
Create a program that will take the encoded message, flip it around, remove any characters that are not a letter or a space, and output the hidden message.
### Input Format
A string of characters that represent the encoded message.
### Output Format
A string of character that represent the intended secret message.
### Sample Input
```
d89%l++5r19o7W *o=l645le9H
```
### Sample Output
```
Hello World
```
### Explanation
If you remove everything that isn't a letter or space from the original message and flip it around, you get 'Hello World'.
