# Camel to Snake
The company you are working for is refactoring its entire codebase. It's changing all naming conventions from camel to snake case (camelCasing to snake_casing). Every capital letter is replaced with its lowercase prefixed by an underscore _, except for the first letter, which is lowercased without the underscore, so that SomeName becomes some_name.
## Task
Write a program that takes in a string that has camel casing, and outputs the same string but with snake casing.
### Input Format
A string with camelCasing.
### Output Format
The same string but with snake_casing.
### Sample Input
```
camelCasing
```
### Sample Output
```
camel_casing
```
### Explanation
The capital C was lowercased and prefixed by an underscore.
