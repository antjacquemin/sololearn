# Isogram Detector
An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, whether they are consecutive or non-consecutive.
Your job is to find a way to detect if a word is an isogram.
## Task
Write a program that takes in a string as input, detects if the string is an isogram and outputs true or false based on the result.
### Input Format
A string containing one word.
### Output Format
A string: true or false.
### Sample Input
```
turbulence
```
### Sample Output
```
false
```
