# Name Buddy
You are grouped into groups for a project, and you are supposed to come up with as many famous scientists who have the same first letter of their name as you as possible. Will you have to come up with the answers on your own, or is there somebody in your group that you can work with?

### Input Format
A string of your group members' names separated by spaces, and then a string of your name.
